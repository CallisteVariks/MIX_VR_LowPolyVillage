# MIX_VR_LowPolyVillage

Together with Gear VR and Unity we created a project with a purpose of allowing the user to experience a Low Poly world.
The surroundings are a village on a hill side filled with grass and trees, composed by a couple of houses, a weapons show case, a fireplace that gives the user the feeling of coziness through the fire and smoke effect, and last but not the least a small house at the lake that withholds a boat for enjoying transportation at the lake side.
Thus, the user can through the magic of sight provided by Samsung powered by Oculus enjoy our Low Poly World. This experience is enhanced by enjoying a nice long walk on the green green grass and interacting with some of our tools exhibit throughout the village.
